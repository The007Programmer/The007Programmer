# Hi, I'm MilkshakeTheCoder!

Hi! My name is Aahil. I'm working on developing Discord Bots and learning Python better as a whole. I love basically anything to do with computers. I like to take them apart (my dad has tons of old unused computers) and put them back together. I love to install new operating systems and play around with all the possibilites with different distributions of linux. Soon enough, I intend on learning other languages such as: C, JS, and a better knowledge of HTML/CSS. I’m mainly interested in topics such as discord.py, parsing, python, web-hosting, mongodb, youtube, and video games. I’m currently learning Python and integration with mongodb (also how to fancy-up README.md files lol). I’m collaborating on [Cafe_Bot](https://github.com/MilkshakeTheCoder/Cafe_Bot) with [andrewthederp](https://github.com/andrewthederp). How to reach me: Make an issue on one of my github repositories. I like to watch most movies (as long as they're not princess movies). I enjoy many cuisines and I am slowly learning to make foods from all of them. Most of my code will be posted here on github, because I like uploading big projects here so other people can also see and learn from those. I also just feel that open source projects are more reliable as compared to closed-source projects. Thanks for vising my github page, be sure to explore my repositories, and have a great day!

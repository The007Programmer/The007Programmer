# Hi, I'm The007Programmer!

👋 Hi! My real name is Aahil.

💻 I'm scrapping a lot of my old projects since a lot of my projects were built primarily on web-scraps, and I didn't feel great doing a project with work that wasn't mine. I'm going to re-learn python, and then start original projects, like a chad.

🗣 Soon enough, I intend on learning other languages such as: C, JS, and a better knowledge of HTML/CSS. 

👀 I’m mainly interested in topics such as discord.py, parsing, python, web-hosting, mongodb, youtube, and video games. I’m currently learning Python and integration with mongodb (also how to fancy-up README.md files lol). 

🤝 No collabs rn, hit me up! Working on a logarithm calculator ugh

👨‍💻 I am currently working learning knowledge from books and hackerrank!

📬 How to reach me: Make an issue on one of my github repositories, or click one of the buttons in the [Get In Touch With Me](#get-in-touch-with-me) section below. 

📺 I like to watch most movies (as long as they're not princess movies). 

👨‍🍳 I enjoy many cuisines and I am slowly learning to make foods from all of them. 

🐙 Most of my code will be posted here on github, because I like uploading big projects here so other people can also see and learn from those. 

I also just feel that open source projects are more reliable as compared to closed-source projects. Thanks for vising my github page, be sure to explore my repositories, and have a great day!
